:computer: I'm also building up my portfolio website which I will be deploying very soon...
:books: I've learned a heck of a lot about Python, JavaScript, Java and related technologies over the past couple of months - and I'm eager to learn more!
:computer: I'm itching to get started with my career in tech!
:star2: Fun fact  :star2: : I've seen Wicked 7 times (and every time has been as magical as the last).
