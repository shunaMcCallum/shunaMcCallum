### Hi there!

<br />

## I'm an ex-musician-turned-coder, avid cylist and all-round massive geek!
- I'm currently studying on the 16-week Professional Software Development bootcamp with CodeClan in Glasgow - graduating on 19 August 2022.
- I'm also building up my portfolio website which I will be deploying very soon...
- I've learned a heck of a lot about Python, JavaScript, Java and related technologies over the past couple of months - and I'm eager to learn more!
- I'm itching to get started with my career in tech!
- Fun fact: I've seen Wicked 7 times (and every time has been as magical as the last).
