## Hi there! :wave:

### I'm Shuna, an ex-musician-turned-coder, avid cylist and all-round massive geek!
:books: I'm currently studying on the Professional Software Development bootcamp with CodeClan - graduating on 19 August 2022. <br />
:computer: I'm also building up my portfolio website which I will be deploying very soon... <br />
:books: I've learned so much about programming over the past couple of months - and I'm eager to learn more! <br />
:computer: I'm itching to get started with my career in tech! <br />
:star2: Fun fact: I've seen Wicked 7 times (and every time has been as amazing as the last). <br />

I am currently looking for work so please do contact me if you like the look of my projects!
